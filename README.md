# No_More_TinkerHub üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Aksa's team


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aksa Rose - LBS Institute of Technology for Women, Poojapura

### Project Description
Every time my friends and I chat, no matter where we start, we somehow end up talking about TinkerHub. It‚Äôs become such a regular part of my conversation that even during a late-night talk with my crush, TinkerHub managed to sneak its way in! Finally, he got so tired of it that he joked, "We should keep track of how many times you say 'TinkerHub' in a day." So, I thought, why not make it official? Let‚Äôs build a bot that counts every time I drop the "T-word" and limits me to five mentions‚Äîafter that, I‚Äôm officially cut off!
